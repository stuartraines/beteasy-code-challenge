# .NET Code Challenge

## Setup
- Restore NuGet packages and build in Visual Studio or via command line.

## Remaining tasks
- I have done as much test coverage in the time allotted, but would like to have improved this with more time.
- I have added TODO comments in various places to indicate where improvement could be applied.

## Time Spent
- 2 hours 5 mins
